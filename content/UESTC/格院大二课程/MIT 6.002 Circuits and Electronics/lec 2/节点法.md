# 节点法
## 过程
1. Select **[[参考节点|reference node]]** (ground) from which voltages are measured. 
2. **Label voltages** of remaining nodes with respect to ground. These are the primary unknowns. 
3. Write **KCL** for all but the ground node, substituting device laws and KVL. 
4. Solve for node voltages. 
5. Back solve for branch voltages and currents (i. E., the secondary unknowns)

节点分析方法对于包含[[浮动独立电压源]]的电路并不适用，此时我们可以将其处理为[[超节点]]。
